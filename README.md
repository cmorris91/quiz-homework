I've created the basis for a coding quiz which includes: 

A start button that will initiate asking questions.

a timer that counts down from 60 seconds when the user presses the start button.

4 questions with multiple choice options

Answer buttons that record the correct and incorrect answers

I wasn't able to include what happens after the last question, which would've been the user saving their score
